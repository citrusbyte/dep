DEP(1)

NAME
      dep -- Basic dependency tracking

SYNOPSIS
      dep check
      dep add libname [--pre]
      dep rm libname
      dep install

DESCRIPTION
      check
          Checks that all dependencies are met.

      add
          Fetches the latest version of the library in question
          and automatically adds it to your .gems file.
    
      rm
          Simply removes the corresponding entry in your .gems file.
  
      install
          Installs all the missing dependencies for you. An important
          point here is that it simply does a `gem install` for each
          dependency you have. Dep assumes that you use some form of
          sandboxing like RVM or rbenv-gemset.


INSTALLATION
      $ gem install dep
