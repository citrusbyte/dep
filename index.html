        <h1>DEP(1) -- basic dependency tracking</h1>

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>

<pre><code>dep check
dep add libname [--pre]
dep rm libname
dep install
</code></pre>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>check:
 Checks that all dependencies are met.</p></li>
<li><p>add:
 Fetches the latest version of the library in question
 and automatically adds it to your .gems file.</p></li>
<li><p>rm:
 Simply removes the corresponding entry in your .gems file.</p></li>
<li><p>install:
 Installs all the missing dependencies for you. An important
 point here is that it simply does a <code>gem install</code> for each
 dependency you have. Dep assumes that you use some form of
 sandboxing like gs, RVM or rbenv-gemset.</p></li>
</ul><h2>INSTALLATION</h2>

<pre><code>$ gem install dep
</code></pre>

<h2>HISTORY</h2>

<p>dep is actually more of a workflow than a tool. If you think about
package managers and the problem of dependencies, you can summarize
what you absolutely need from them in just two points:</p>

<ol>
<li>When you build an application which relies on 3rd party libraries,
it's best to explicitly declare the version numbers of these
libraries.</li>
<li>You can either bundle the specific library version together with
your application, or you can have a list of versions.</li>
</ol><p>The first approach is handled by vendoring the library. The second
approach typically is done using Bundler. But why do you need such
a complicated tool when all you need is simply listing version numbers?</p>

<p>We dissected what we were doing and eventually reached the following
workflow:</p>

<ol>
<li>We maintain a .gems file for every application which lists the
libraries and the version numbers.</li>
<li>We omit dependencies of dependencies in that file, the reason being
is that that should already be handled by the package manager
(typically rubygems).</li>
<li>Whenever we add a new library, we add the latest version.</li>
<li>When we pull the latest changes, we want to be able to rapidly
check if the dependencies we have is up to date and matches what
we just pulled.</li>
</ol><p>So after doing this workflow manually for a while, we decided to
build the simplest tool to aid us with our workflow.</p>

<ul>
<li>The first point is handled implicitly by dep. You can also specify
a different file by doing dep -f.</li>
<li>The second point is more of an implementation detail. We thought about
doing dependencies, but then, why re-implement something that's already
done for you by rubygems?</li>
<li>The third point (and also the one which is most inconvenient), is
handled by dep add.</li>
</ul><p>The manual workflow for <code>dep add</code> would be:</p>

<pre><code>gem search -r "^ohm$" [--pre] # check and remember the version number
echo "ohm -v X.x.x" &gt;&gt; .gems
</code></pre>

<p>If you try doing that repeatedly, it will quickly become cumbersome.</p>

<p>The fourth and final point is handled by typing dep check or simply dep.
Practically speaking it's just:</p>

<pre><code>git pull
dep
</code></pre>

<p>And that's it. The dep command typically happens in 0.2 seconds which
is something we LOVE.</p>
